What was your motivation?
This project was a good starting base in what it is like to create games, as a big fan of video games this was a big project to tackle.

Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I wanted to try my hand at building a game to see the ins and outs of it, obviously this is a web browser game not a full developed game and might not even be designed right but its a start.

What problem does it solve?
This is a quiz game that will allow the user to change the questions and test who ever they want with these inter changable questions.

What did you learn?
I learnt that this is a lot harder then it look, to get the timer right, questions to pop up and to answer without a submit button took a lot of time.

What makes your project stand out?
honestly nothing but i did put a lot more hours in then i thought i would and a lot more frustration i've had making this project.
